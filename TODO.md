# Things TODO in wview-rrd

* move configurable parameters out to config file.

  * database location
  * preferred units
  * names of extra sensors

* add english/metric units option to interface

* re-write rrdgraphcgi.pl as an actual object module, suitable for
  CPAN, unless this already exits.  Something like CGI::RRDs?
